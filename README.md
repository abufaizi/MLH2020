## Anonymous Student Polling and Classroom Aid for Teachers/Students

This application enables students to communicate their comfort level with their teacher without raising their hands in class. 
There can definitely be anxiety during class when a student does not understand the lesson during its progression, 
this allows the teacher to know how their students are doing during class in an aggregate and anonymous way.
